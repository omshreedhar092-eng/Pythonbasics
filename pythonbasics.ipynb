        "\n",
        "1.what is python and why is it popular ?\n",
        "\n",
        "python is programming language used to write instructions to computer to perform various computational  operations  ,\n",
        "python is very simple and popular language among the developers community as it has a extensive library for very kinds of development like website development , data science , machine learning and devops .\n",
        "python has simple syntax and so it is easy to learn.\n",
        "___________________________\n",
        "2.what is an interpreter in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Python interpreter is a program that directly reads and executes Python code. Instead of translating the entire program into machine code in one go (like a compiler), it processes the instructions line by line at runtime, which allows for immediate feedback and easier debugging.\n",
        "_______________-\n",
        "3.what are pre-defined keywords in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "pre-defined keywords are set of words reserved by the python language to perform  various operation such as arithmetic operation , logical operation , bitwise operation etc\n",
        "_____________\n",
        " 4.can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        " NO , keywords cannot  be used as variable names ,  \n",
        " python will show the syntax error as those keywords have specific operation to perform .\n",
        "____________________\n",
        " 5.what is mutablity in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " mutuablity is ability to change the data stored in the variable ,\n",
        "_____\n",
        " 6.why are list mutable ,but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "The distinction is by design: lists are implemented as mutable sequences to support dynamic operations, while tuples are implemented as immutable sequences to provide a fixed, efficient, and reliable data structure suitable for records and situations where data integrity is paramount.\n",
        "________________\n",
        " 7.what is the difference between '==' and 'is' operator in python?\n",
        "\n",
        " == :The == operator checks if the objects have the same value. It determines if the data stored within the objects is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        " is : The is operator checks if two variables point to the exact same object in the computer's memory. It is a check for object identity.\n",
        "_____________________________\n",
        "8.what are logical operators in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical operator are used to perform logical operations .\n",
        "logical operator are  && , || , !=\n",
        "_____________________________________\n",
        "\n",
        "9.what is type casting in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting is the process of converting the datatype of datavariable value .\n",
        "typecasting is of 2 types - implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        " ______________________________________________\n",
        "10.what is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit type casting -python understand or type cast some variable value without mentioning it datatype .For example -the value entered through input keyword is type casted as string .\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit type casting - method to type cast certain other datatype is called explicit type casting. for example type casting integer datatype 8 into float datatype 8.0\n",
        "____________________________________________\n",
        "11.what is the purpose of conditional statements in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional statements are used as test to proceed to execute further statement of the block .\n",
        "if the condition is TRUE then statement of the block is executed .\n",
        "if the condition is FALSE then statement of the block is not executed .\n",
        "________________________________________________\n",
        "12.how does the elif statements work?\n",
        "\n",
        "elif statements condition is tested  after the false output in the if condition.\n",
        "elif is the conditional after the failure of if condition and also if the elif conditional statement fails else sttement is executed .\n",
        "\n",
        "if (failed condition ):\n",
        "\n",

        "        statement block\n",
        "\n",
        "_______________________\n",
        "13.what is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "FOR loop is  more suitable when the number of iterations to perform is known whereas the WHILE loop is suitable when the number of iteration is unknown .\n",
        "while loop executes the entire statement block till the condition is true .\n",
        "FOR loop terminates when the sequence is  exhausted.\n",
        "WHILE loop terminates when the condition becomes false.\n",
        "_____________________________\n",
        "14.describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop .\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario: Validating User Input\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a program that asks a user to enter their age. The program needs to keep asking indefinitely until the user enters a valid, positive integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why while is better here:\n",
        "\n",
        "You do not know ahead of time how many attempts the user will take to enter a correct age. They might enter valid input on the first try, or the tenth.\n",
        "The while loop naturally fits this structure because it continues as long as the input is invalid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why a for loop is unsuitable here:\n",
        "\n",
        "A for loop requires a defined sequence to iterate over. You cannot define a sequence that says \"loop an indeterminate number of times until something is true.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "You could technically force a for loop to work using an infinite loop (for _ in iter(int, 1): or similar workarounds with break), but this is an unnatural and less readable use of the loop structure."
